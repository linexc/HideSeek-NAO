The detect_aruco package is aiming at localization through different aruco markers and finding the path to the destination through A star path planner. 

For starting the package. Please at first roslaunch detect_aruco detect_aruco.launch in order to activate the localization server. 

And then rossrun tf_broadcaster.cpp for displaying the aruco info in the rviz. 

The server for calculating the transformation matrix from arucomarker to the nao frame is activitated through rosrun getTransformMatrix.

If the destinate need to be drawn, the server drawRoute.cpp need to be active, too. The serer is initially designed for drawing path which is calculated through A* path planner. 

For publishing the aruco information including the its rvec and tvec, as well as its location regarding to the nao, please rosrun the yu_dect which activates the aruco_finder.cpp

For the A* planner, the python file a_star.py should be rosrun. And its server walk_general.py in the package detect_walk  for moving should be active.
